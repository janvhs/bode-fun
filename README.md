# Hi, I’m Jan ✌️

I am a professional full-stack engeneer, but I prefer the backend or developing CLI programs.

To get an overview, about what I do in my spare time, please take a look at my pinned repos below.

I'm currently trying to get started with compiler development and I'm planing to create the simple
statically typed language [Mirim](https://git.bode.fun/mirim), which compiles to WASM, before tackling my *dream toy language* [Bingus](https://git.bode.fun/bingus).


## A few bullet points about me:

- 🐳 "The Linux and Docker guy" ~ A coworker
- :octocat: I’m interested in skateboarding, music, art and tech
- ❤️ My favourite band is "Temmis" from Hamburg and I enjoy going to art museums
- 🐉 I’m currently learning **Go** and a bit of **C++**
- 🫡 I write **PHP with Laravel**, **Swift** and **TypeScript** on a per need basis
